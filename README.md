Refining the way you interact with your Vial-powered keyboards.

Pipette is an independent, Electron-based keymap editor compatible with [Vial](https://get.vial.today/).  \
Communicates with Vial keyboards via USB HID to configure keymaps, macros, lighting, and more.

> ### This is [rossw42](https://github.com/rossw42/pipette-desktop)'s fork
>
> A fork of [darakuneko/pipette-desktop](https://github.com/darakuneko/pipette-desktop),
> currently based on upstream **v0.4.20**. What it adds:
>
> - **Key Notes** — user-editable semantic key labels drawn on the keys (per keyboard, per
>   layer, per matrix position), visible in the editor, Typing View, and the always-on-top
>   overlay. Save/load them as a `.json` sidecar file.
> - **Typing View layer fix** — the layer indicator now follows `TG()`/`TO()`/`TT()`/`DF()`
>   toggles, not just momentary `MO`/`LT`/`LM`.
> - **Windows build/launch fixes** — `pnpm dev` and `pnpm dist:win` work without Visual Studio
>   C++ build tools, and `dist:win` no longer exits 0 without building anything.
> - **Fork maintenance tooling** — `scripts/sync-upstream.mjs` and `scripts/verify-fork.mjs`.
>
> **The download links below are upstream's releases and do not contain these changes.** This
> fork publishes no binaries; build it yourself (`pnpm install` then `pnpm dist:win`, and run
> `dist\win-unpacked\Pipette.exe`).
>
> See **[FORK.md](./FORK.md)** for the details, the known-broken upstream tests, and how the
> fork is kept in sync. Everything below is upstream's documentation and applies here too.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform:

- **Windows (x64)**  
  https://github.com/darakuneko/pipette-desktop/releases/latest/download/Pipette-win-x64.exe

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**  
  https://github.com/darakuneko/pipette-desktop/releases/latest/download/Pipette-mac-arm64.dmg

- **Linux (x86_64 AppImage)**  
  https://github.com/darakuneko/pipette-desktop/releases/latest/download/Pipette-linux-x86_64.AppImage

## System Requirements

Pipette's window has a minimum size of **1280×1024**, and defaults to **1440×1024** (or larger is recommended) on first launch.

It might feel a bit large — but keyboards are wide, so this is what it takes to work with them comfortably. Sorry!

On a display whose usable work area (screen space minus the Dock, taskbar, or menu bar) is smaller than that minimum — common on smaller MacBook screens — the window is clamped to fit the visible area instead.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1.  Connect your Vial-compatible keyboard via USB.
2.  Launch Pipette.
3.  The keyboard will be detected automatically.
4.  Select a layer and start editing key assignments.

## Operation Guide

-   [Operation Guide](https://darakuneko.github.io/pipette-desktop/guide.html)

## Platform Setup

### Linux

#### AppImage executable

Make the AppImage executable before launching:

```bash
chmod +x Pipette-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

#### AppImage Sandbox (Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+)

On distributions that restrict unprivileged user namespaces (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13+ via AppArmor's `unprivileged_userns_restricted` flag), the AppImage may fail to launch with a sandbox / user namespace error.

Create an AppArmor profile that permits the namespace:

```bash
# Adjust the profile path to match where you placed the AppImage
sudo tee /etc/apparmor.d/pipette >/dev/null <<'EOF'
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>

profile pipette /home/YOUR_USER/Applications/Pipette-linux-x86_64.AppImage flags=(unconfined) {
  userns,

  include if exists <local/pipette>
}
EOF

sudo systemctl reload apparmor.service
```

Replace `YOUR_USER` and adjust the filename/path to match your setup.

#### udev Rules

udev rules are required to access keyboards:

```bash
sudo cp scripts/99-vial.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

#### Monitor App on Wayland (GNOME Shell extension)

The typing-view Monitor App toggle tags each minute of recording with the active application name. X11 exposes the focused window directly, but on Wayland the desktop sandboxes window focus, so Pipette falls back to a GNOME Shell extension.

To enable Monitor App on Wayland, install the **Focused Window D-Bus** GNOME Shell extension:

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5592/focused-window-d-bus/

Without the extension Monitor App silently records `null` for every minute on Wayland — keystroke counts still flow to the analytics, but per-app breakdowns are unavailable. Compositors other than GNOME Shell (KDE Plasma, Sway, etc.) are not currently supported; each would need its own focus-bridge implementation.

#### Distribution Policy

Pipette is officially distributed only as an AppImage on Linux.

We do not provide or document distro-specific packages (.deb, .rpm, AUR, Flatpak, Snap, etc.) in order to keep the maintenance and support scope focused on the AppImage release.

Community-maintained packages may exist, but they are not officially supported.

### macOS

#### Accessibility permission for Monitor App

The typing-view Monitor App toggle requires the **Accessibility** permission on macOS to resolve the foreground application name. Grant access in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and add Pipette Desktop to the allowed list.

Without this permission, Monitor App silently records `null` for every minute on macOS — keystroke counts still flow to the analytics, but per-app breakdowns are unavailable.

### Keyboard Configuration

- **Keymap Editor** — Layer-based key assignment with drag & drop, auto-advance, and a searchable keycode palette with Mod Mask/Mod-Tap wrapper modes. Basic tab supports ANSI, ISO, JIS, and List views with International (INT1–5) and Language (LANG1–5) keycode groups. Reorganized key picker tabs (System, Behavior, dedicated Combo/Key Override/Alt Repeat Key tabs) with instant key selection. Keymap change history with undo/redo via toolbar buttons, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl+Y/Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z), and popover undo/redo. Key popover includes a layer switching sidebar for quick layer navigation without closing the popover
- **Layout Editor** — Physical layout switching via slide-out panel (split backspace, bottom row variants, etc.)
- **Tap Dance** — Multi-tap key behaviors (tap, hold, double-tap, tap+hold, custom tapping term) with inline favorites
- **Combo** — Simultaneous key-press to trigger output keys; inline tile grid with detail editor modal and inline favorites
- **Key Override** — Replace key output when specific modifiers are held; inline tile grid with detail editor modal and inline favorites
- **Alternate Repeat Key** — Context-aware alternate repeat key bindings; inline tile grid with detail editor modal and inline favorites
- **Macro Editor** — Create and record macros with text, tap, hold, release, and delay actions (v1/v2 protocol) with inline favorites
- **RGB Lighting** — QMK Backlight, RGBLight, and VialRGB configuration
- **QMK Settings** — Dynamic firmware settings with boolean/integer fields
- **Matrix Tester** — Real-time key switch verification (20 ms polling)

### Data Management

- **Snapshots** — Save and restore complete keyboard states (keymap, macros, dynamic entries, QMK settings)
- **Favorites** — Inline favorites panel in every editor for saving/loading reusable configurations; not tied to a specific keyboard, so saved entries can be loaded on any compatible keyboard. Per-entry export, bulk import/export supported. Individual favorites can be uploaded to Pipette Hub
- **Data Modal** — Centralized favorite and Hub post management from the device selection screen
- **Export** — Download keymap as `.vil`, `.pipette`, `keymap.c`, PDF keymap cheat sheet, or PDF layout export (key outlines with summary pages for dynamic entries)
- **Import** — Load `.vil` files to restore keyboard state
- **Offline Editing** — Edit `.pipette` files without a physical keyboard connected; uses the embedded keyboard definition for a virtual layout

### Cloud Sync (Google Drive appDataFolder)

Sync your snapshots, favorites, and per-keyboard settings across devices via [Google Drive appDataFolder](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/appdata).  \
The appDataFolder is **not** regular Google Drive storage — it is a hidden, app-specific folder that only Pipette can access. Your personal Drive files are never touched.

See [Data Guide](https://darakuneko.github.io/pipette-desktop/guide.html#data) for details on what is synced and how your data is protected.

### Pipette Hub

Upload and share your keymaps and favorite configurations on [Pipette Hub](https://pipette-hub-worker.keymaps.workers.dev), a community keymap gallery. Keyboard snapshots, tap dance, macro, combo, key override, and alt repeat key configurations can all be shared.

See [Data Guide](https://darakuneko.github.io/pipette-desktop/guide.html#data) for details on how Hub authentication works.

### Utilities

- **Typing Test** — Built-in typing test with WPM/accuracy tracking, downloadable language packs, and per-keyboard history
- **Typing View** — View-only mode displaying only the keyboard layout in a compact, resizable window with always-on-top support — ideal for overlaying on other applications
- **Multilingual UI** — Multiple languages supported via importable language packs; manage, import, and download packs from Pipette Hub in Settings → Tools → Language Packs
- **Light / Dark / System theme** with importable **Theme Packs** — download community colour schemes from Pipette Hub or author your own `.json` pack
- **Keyboard layout override** (QWERTY, Dvorak, etc.) for correct label display
- **Configurable panel side** (left / right)
- **Auto-lock timer**

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start Electron dev server
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm test         # Run tests
pnpm test:watch   # Tests (watch mode)
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm format       # Prettier
```

## Build & Distribution

```bash
pnpm dist         # Package for all platforms
pnpm dist:linux   # Linux (AppImage)
pnpm dist:win     # Windows (NSIS installer)
pnpm dist:mac     # macOS (dmg)
```

## Architecture

Raw HID I/O runs in the **main process** via `node-hid`. Protocol logic runs in the **preload** layer and delegates HID I/O through IPC.

```
Main Process        — node-hid transport, CSP, file I/O, window management,
                      cloud sync, Hub API, snapshot/favorite stores
Preload (sandbox)   — IPC bridge, VIA/Vial protocol, Keyboard state
Renderer            — React UI (Tailwind CSS)
Shared              — Types, constants, IPC channels
```

## Data & Privacy

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! In particular:

- **Translations** — Create a language pack `.json` (use the built-in English pack as a template — export it from Settings → Tools → Language Packs) and share it on [Pipette Hub](https://pipette-hub-worker.keymaps.workers.dev) or submit a PR.
  See the [Operation Guide](https://darakuneko.github.io/pipette-desktop/guide.html) §6.3 for the pack format and management workflow.
- **Theme packs** — Design a colour theme `.json` and share it on Pipette Hub.
  See the [Theme Pack Authoring Guide](https://darakuneko.github.io/pipette-desktop/guide.html#theme) for the full colour token reference and design tips.
- **Keyboard layout composite labels** — `KeyboardLayoutDef.compositeLabels` in `src/renderer/data/keyboard-layouts.ts`
  lets a layout override the label of an individual composite keycode (e.g. `LALT(KC_L)` → "Cmd L" on macOS).
  Add the full qmkId → display string mapping to the relevant layout. Reviewers must check that the
  same label is not assigned to two different composite qmkIds within one layout (label collision).
- **Bug reports & feature requests** — Open an issue to let us know.
